# Unlocking-Tennis-Data-with-SportRadar-API
The SportRadar Event Explorer project aims to develop a comprehensive solution for managing, visualizing, and analyzing sports competition data extracted from the Sportradar API. The application will parse JSON data, store structured information in a relational database, and provide intuitive insights into tournaments, competition hierarchies, and event details. This project is designed to assist sports enthusiasts, analysts, and organizations in understanding competition structures and trends while exploring detailed event-specific information interactively.
